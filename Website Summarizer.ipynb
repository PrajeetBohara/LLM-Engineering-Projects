    "You may notice that if you try `display_summary(\"https://openai.com\")` - it doesn't work! That's because OpenAI has a fancy website that uses Javascript. There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
